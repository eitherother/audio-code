# audio-code
Supercollider code I have written in conjunction with other creative work. SC is very powerful but it tends to be dense, so I have done my best to simplify, comment, and format in ways that I hope will make it easier to follow. Additional recordings using some of this code are available on my website, https://www.eitherother.com.

The three clarinet recordings in this project come from the University of Iowa Electronic Music Studios, a great resource for instrumental samples: http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html.
